system around the <strong>Auroral Mirage</strong> weather pattern.</p>\n<p>They will make it so that the weather condition will not spawn until the instance environment allows for it, meaning that there's no active Critical Encounters at the time.</p>\n<p>This will push the weather condition back as it aligns with instance content but otherwise won't change the amount of it

levelling your <strong>Phantom Jobs</strong> and <strong>Knowledge Level</strong>.<br><br>The way this system works is very simple, as you kill mobs you will get an increasing % bonus on experience and rewards as you raise the chain.<br><br>As the chain increase, the timer to maintain the chain going will gradually shorten, requiring you to kill faster and faster to maintain the chain going.<br><br>To start a chain and to maintain it, you need to be killing mobs above your level that have the chaining icon above their name.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

be done either alone, or in a group.<br><br>Although it's safer to do it in a group, the requirements to chain are also increased accordingly.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solo:</strong> Mob needs to be 2 levels higher than your knowledge level.</li>\n<li><strong>2 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 3 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>\n<li><strong>3 or 4 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 4 or 5 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>\n<li><strong>5 or 6 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 6 or 7 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>\n<li><strong>7 or 8 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 7 or 8 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Persistent Pots</h3>\n<p>These little soulkins can become your companion for some nice rewards.<br><br>They are involved in two FATEs within the occult crescent, and doing these FATEs will give you a chance to receive a buff (<strong>Cache Me If You Can</strong>) that will have one of these following you for 15 minutes.<br><br>When you have one of these little guys following you, you can use the Magical Elixir to get him to point you in the general direction of a treasure chest.<br><br>Once you're close enough to the chest, using the magical elixir will show the chest instead.<br><br>The treasure chests can come in 3 varieties, and give increasing rewards.<br><br>There's also a chance that the pot really likes you and doesn't disappear after the first one, sticking around to guide you to a new chest.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Battle content</h2>\n<p>Besides killing overworld mobs, there's more fighting to be done in Occult Crescent.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight\"><strong>⚠️ <span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\">Warning</span></strong><br><br>Both FATEs and Critical Encounters are <strong>knowledge level agnostic</strong> and you will be able to participate at any point in time.<br><br>Do be careful tho, if you're venturing into higher level areas, mind your step between the roaming mobs as many of them will easily one shot you if you're moving carelessly.<br><br>Try to stick to going around them behind their backs by targeting them and looking at where their front arrow is pointed.</p>\n<h3>FATEs</h3>\n<p>FATEs spawn all around the map and can be challenged by any number of players up to the instance limit.</p>\n<div class=\"el-p\">\n<p dir=\"auto\">You may join at any point in the FATE to contribute.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Critical Encounters</h3>\n<p>Critical Encounters also known as CEs are large-scale bosses.</p>\n<p>Any number of players can participate in these up to the instance limit, however, these will be limited in access compared to FATEs.</p>\n<p>While FATEs allow you to join at any point, CEs will only be available to the players that are within the <strong>CE combat area</strong> before the starting timer reaches 0 seconds.</p>\n<p>After the timer is over, whoever is inside the area will be teleported into the combat arena and nobody else might join.</p>\n<h3>The Forked Tower: Blood</h3>\n<p>This is a high end level 100 raid that can only be accessed from within the Occult Crescent.</p>\n<p>Personally, you need to be <strong>knowledge level 20</strong> and the instance scales from a minimum of 16 players up to the maximum of 48 players.</p>\n<p>I will not go too in depth on this, as the scope of this information page is not the raid, which would warrant a whole weyway page by itself.</p>\n<h4>Accessing the tower</h4>\n<p>To enter the tower, there's a set of requirements that must be met first.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The zone weather needs to be <strong>Auroral Mirages</strong></li>\n<li>A minimum of 16 players need to use <strong>Sanguine Ciphers</strong> on the <strong>Cipher Reliquary</strong> at the centre of the map.</li>\n<li>The node will activate and for a brief period of time it will teleport players inside, up to the 48 person limit.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Where do I get a Sanguine Cipher?</h4>\n<p>You can purchase these from the <a href=\"https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Expedition_Antiquarian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Expedition Antiquarian</strong></a> for <strong>600 Silver</strong> coins or <strong>960 Gold</strong> coins.</p>\n<h4>I didn't go in, what happens to my ciphers?</h4>\n<p>Players can contribute more than one cipher, as well as more than 16 people can contribute theirs, this means that even if you use a cipher to go in, you might not get selected.</p>\n<p>No worries tho, if you used your ciphers and did not get selected, they will be refunded back to you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Treasure</h2>\n<p>The Occult Crescent is dotted all around with treasure chests, from bronze to gold, they're all personal and filled with goodies - So if you see one, take it!</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">✅ <span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong>Spawning chests!</strong></span><br><br>The way the spawns work are tied to activities being done inside your instance, so for every <strong>chain kill, CE</strong> or <strong>FATE</strong> completed, one chest will spawn for you, up to a maximum of 30 bronze and 4 silver at a time.</p>\n<h3>Bronze and Silver</h3>\n<p>These are the most common chests you will find in the zone.<br><br><strong>Bronze </strong>treasure chests will give you one item, while <strong>silver </strong>chests will grant you three items.<br><br>The loot table for these is honestly huge, you can check it here.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Loot</th>\n<th>Bronze Drop Rates</th>\n<th>Silver Drop

His field of study? Anima, an essence he considers to be a reflection of the soul. Through a chance encounter with the master craftsman Gerolt, he and the legendary blacksmith have joined forces to create a weapon the likes of which the realm has never seen.</p>\n<p class=\"align-right\">Patch 3.1 Official Site</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though it is only a matter of time before the anima fully develops, Ardashir believes he can hasten the process. To that end, he voyages to Idyllshire in search of an acquaintance, one Ulan. A fellow researcher and enthusiast of all creatures arcane, she has devoted her life to their study and methods by which they can be enhanced. Could her work be the key to unlocking the anima's potential?</p>\n<p class=\"align-right\">Patch 3.3 Official Site</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After many tests and trials, the anima would appear to be at the pinnacle of perfection. To that end, Ardashir is making preparations to return to the Near East that he might present his findings. Gerolt, on the other hand, believes there is yet work to be done. Could our resident drunkard and realm-renown blacksmith hold the key to the anima's advancement?</p>\n<p class=\"align-right\">Patch 3.4 Official Site</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As repair work on the Allagan droid progresses, it becomes clear that it won't be long until the anima weapon is fortified at last. Just what form will the anima take once all is said and done? Well, that's the million-gil question.</p>\n<p class=\"align-right\">Patch 3.5 Official Site</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Prerequesites</h2>\n<p>As usual, there's a good website to help track where you

this relic has much less steps than the ARR one, the costs are condensed, as such, these quests will take well over <strong>8000 Allagan Tomestone of Poetics</strong> to complete, it's recommended that you avoid the 2000 cap on tomestones by spending on whatever materials you can buy along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"el-p\">The tables below will highlight some of the items that can be purchased and stocked up in preparation for the steps that will come.</p>\nSome items will not be available to buy until you reach the step and unlock them.<br>Note that I might've missed something here, but

Now, it is the traditional weaponry of these old mantles that are sought, the means of their making long since lost to the ages. It would seem this longing for things past and old is not limited merely to the schools of war and magic. The reformation of Eorzea's Grand Companies was born of a longing in the hearts of the free peoples of Eorzea — a longing for the days of old and the peace they knew. It is a sentiment that has since spread to the realm's adventurers, guiding them toward the rediscovery of trades from a former age that had all but died out. Small wonder, then, that those who have mastered these ancient ways of battle and sorcery now seek the weapons of eld which will enable them to realize the truest expression of their newfound powers. Thus have adventurers begun their quest for the relics.</p>\n<p class=\"align-right\">- FFXIV Lodestone</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"prerequisites\">\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Disciple of War or Magic at Level 50 with job quests completed.</li>\n<li>Completion of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/The_Ultimate_Weapon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-tooltip-position=\"top\"> The Ultimate Weapon</a>.</li>\n<li>Completion of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/The_Weaponsmith_of_Legend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-tooltip-position=\"top\"> The Weaponsmith of Legend. </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> <strong> ⚠️ <span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\"> Note! </span> </strong> <br><br></span> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> Most of the quests for the Zodiac Weapons are not repeatable like newer relics. <br></span> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> Instead, instructions will be provided and the quest completes itself. <br></span> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> After you complete the steps for the quests, the required items can then be turned in to the vendor with the weapon in your inventory. <br></span> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> If you need to review information, refer to this guide or otherwise find it in-game under the </span> <strong style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\"> Completed </strong> <span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> section of your journal. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><span style=\"color: #3598db;\"> <strong> ℹ️ See also </strong> </span> <br><br><span style=\"background-color: rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.1); color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> Some of the steps will require that you equip the relic weapon to be able to complete the objectives. </span></p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"initial-prep\">\n<h2>Initial Preparations</h2>\n<p>A good website that can help sorting through this unfathomable grind: <br><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://ffxivrelictracker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> https://ffxivrelictracker.com/ </a></p>\n<p>If you complete one full weapon grind, you will unlock the repeatable quests for the subsequent weapons, speeding up the process if doing all of them.</p>\n<p>As some steps require materials bought with <strong> Allagan Tomestone of Poetics, Grand Company Seals or Allied Seals </strong> you can get ahead gathering some of them before starting.
