<p>This Live Letter starts with a Q&amp;A about some issues/queries that were gathered by the community and developer teams.</p>
<p>Yoshi touches the topic of the team not improving processes to deal with their increased scale, which leads to declined quality of service and more bugs to hotfix.</p>

<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/3.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-xs.jpg 640w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-sm.jpg 768w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-md.jpg 1024w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-lg.jpg 1366w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-xl.jpg 1600w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/19/responsive/3-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure>
<p class="dropcap">Q:I wish I could enter the Forked Tower with a preformed alliance.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A:Yoshi felt the support systems in DRS were too high, they wanted to reduce these.</p>
<p>As of right now, it's hard to get into the same instance with 48 people, leading to what people call "island gacha" trying to go into the instance with the full premade.</p>
<p>They will implement a feature in patch 7.3 to allow a premade alliance to queue in to the same instance at once.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned that a list view to see who submitted cyphers and how many were submitted by each person will be coming.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: I wish there was a normal and savage version of the Forked Tower, like there was with Delubrum Reginae.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: They refer to the lack of normal and savage modes for Forked Tower as a cost limitation (budget or time?)</p>
<p>For this first zone it will have to be like this, but for future zones in the Occult Crescent, they will try to have both a normal and a savage version of the instances.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: When magic pot and happy bunny coffers contain only materia and fireworks, the rewards feel inadequate for the effort required.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: While the coffers also give gil as a reward, they understand that they were off on how rewarding these feel.</p>
<p>They will be discussing this further and trying to change it for the better.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: Enemies in FATEs can be defeated too quickly. Unless you're paying close attention, a FATE may be completed before you've even arrived.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: This is not something that is limited to the Occult Crescent instance, but it's difficult to adjust parameters to match when an instance is crowded and when it's empty, on the fly.</p>
<p>They feel as a general rule it's better to have these parameters adjusted to lean on the side of easier rather than harder but they will be looking into the parameters and try to finetune them.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: Please increase the drop rate for demiatma and soul shards.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: This is down to personal RNG (luck) and they will not be buffing the drop rates for now.</p>
<p>For transparency, they provided the current drop rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical Encounter drop rate is at: 20%</li>
<li>FATE drop rate is at: 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also mentioned that back in the grind for the <a href="https://weyway.com/zodiac-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARR relic weapon</a>, atma drop rates at content release had only a 2% drop rate, that was steadily increased over time and now sits at 20%.</p>
<p>They want to keep random drops as a feature in the game and not have players just collect everything at once and abandon the content.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: The window for auroral mirages is too short, making it impossible to get there in time if you were in critical encounter.<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: They're changing the system around the <strong>Auroral Mirage</strong> weather pattern.</p>
<p>They will make it so that the weather condition will not spawn until the instance environment allows for it, meaning that there's no active Critical Encounters at the time.</p>
<p>This will push the weather condition back as it aligns with instance content but otherwise won't change the amount of it spawning.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Q: Can you allow us to use mounts?<br><br></p>
<p class="dropcap">A: In <strong>7.3</strong>, you will be able to do it and for the new zones of cosmic exploration releasing in <strong>7.31</strong> mounts will be enabled right from the start.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A: Will be added! 🎉</p>

<h3>Chat Bubbles</h3>
<p>They're basically done with the feature but it's still under active development.</p>
<p>They're still working out the implementation, my guess is basically settings and customization implementations (<em>as seen in the image below there will be different coloured bubbles for players, npcs, etc, which might have new settings added to the game</em>) as well as things like range and all of those considerations that come with this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will be optional and disabled by default</li>
<li>Text will continue to appear in the chat log as normal</li>
<li>Can be turned ON/OFF according to chat mode (say, shout, fc, etc)</li>
<li>Bubble and Font colour can be set according to chat mode too</li>
<li>Can be disabled during battle and PvP</li>
<li>Can be set to display 1 or 2 rows of text</li>
<li>Text will be truncated after a certain limit (check chat logs for that)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hair and Headgear changes</h3>
<h4>Expanded headgear support for Hrothgar and Vieras</h4>
<p>After many families requesting this, and years of waiting.</p>
<p>Various headgear will now display on Hrothgar and Viera characters.</p>
<p>Further support for metal stuff (like helmets) will be coming still, those are not so good and still being worked on.</p>
<h5>Options to Hide Viera Ears</h5>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to choose whether or not to display the ears on certain headgear</li>
<li>ON/OFF subcommand to the visor toggle for this.</li>
<li>Setting will be saved on a <strong>Gear Set</strong> basis</li>

<p>This one will <strong>NOT be</strong> for 7.3, it's just some highlights that they're still actively working on it. They're broadly aiming this feature to come out in <strong>7.4</strong> but no promisses.</p>
<p>Some features they're discussing still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions to display the board whenever desired, including during battle.</li>
<li>Highlight jobs, including own job for clarity in reading positionings.</li>
<li>Ability to share the whiteboards (probably like posting them outside of sharing them with your party)</li>

Be not fooled by the lush and fertile island you spy on the horizon─men and vessels alike have been lost to its allure, never to be seen again. Yes, the wisest choice is to dismiss it as mere illusion. But of course, there are inevitably those who cannot resist the call of adventure.</p>

<h2>Systems</h2>
<p>This zone will have a set of systems that add to the experience.<br>The most obvious ones will be the <strong>Phantom Jobs</strong> and the separate levelling system called <strong>Knowledge Level</strong>.</p>
<article>
<h3>Knowledge Level</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>levelling system</strong> within the Occult Crescent.<br>It will accompany you through all your journey within this zone irrespective of any other systems.</p>
<p>There are <strong>20 levels</strong> to go through and each of these will determine the damage dealth and received by you when fighting regular mobs within the zone.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">🚨 <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Warning</strong></span><br><br>As you reach <strong>level 5</strong> you will no longer be protected and any deaths while out in the field will result in loss of knowledge points <strong>if you do not get resurrected by someone else.</strong><br><br>This means that if you die and you resurrect in the base camp too many times, you will lose knowledge and might end up with a <strong>demotion</strong> down to a lower level.<br><br>At <strong>level 20</strong> this is guaranteed to lower you to <strong>19</strong>.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Phantom Jobs</h3>
<p>Phantom Jobs are for the most part an addition to your combat capabilities.<br>These are similar to the <strong>Logos Actions / Lost Actions</strong> systems in previous Field Operations.</p>
<p>You can equip and swap Phantom Jobs anywhere inside the Occult Crescent, with each job offering you a set of new actions that you can use to aid you and complement your regular job.</p>
<p>Depending on what you're trying to achieve, some jobs will make you life much easier.</p>
<p>Alongside the job specific actions, there are also two things:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">The Freelancer job is your default job and it levels passively as you master other jobs.</li>
<li dir="auto">As you master each phantom job, you will receive a permanent stacking buff called Phantom Mastery which increases your damage and healing potency within the Occult Crescent zones.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kill Chaining</h3>
<p>This system functions in the overworld mobs and is the best way to grind <strong>Gold Coins</strong> alongside levelling your <strong>Phantom Jobs</strong> and <strong>Knowledge Level</strong>.</p>
<p>The way this system works is very simple, as you kill mobs you will get an increasing % bonus on experience and rewards as you raise the chain.<br>As the chain increase, the timer to maintain the chain going will gradually shorten, requiring you to kill faster and faster to maintain the chain going.</p>
<p>To start a chain and to maintain it, you need to be killing mobs above your level that have the chaining icon above their name.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/Pasted-image-20250602011849.png" alt="" width="309" height="78" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-xs.png 640w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-sm.png 768w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-md.png 1024w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-lg.png 1366w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-xl.png 1600w ,https://weyway.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Pasted-image-20250602011849-2xl.png 1920w"></figure>
<p>This can be done either alone, or in a group.<br>Although it's safer to do it in a group, the requirements to chain are also increased accordingly.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solo:</strong> Mob needs to be 2 levels higher than your knowledge level.</li>
<li><strong>2 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 3 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>
<li><strong>3 or 4 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 4 or 5 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>
<li><strong>5 or 6 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 6 or 7 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>
<li><strong>7 or 8 Players:</strong> Mob needs to be 7 or 8 levels higher than the balanced party's knowledge level.</li>

<h3>Persistent Pots</h3>
<p>These little soulkins can become your companion for some nice rewards.</p>
<p>They are involved in two FATEs within the occult crescent, and doing these FATEs will give you a chance to receive a buff (<strong>Cache Me If You Can</strong>) that will have one of these following you for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>When you have one of these little guys following you, you can use the <strong>Magical Elixir</strong> key item as many times as you want, to the to get him to point you in the general direction of a treasure chest.<br>Once you're close enough to the chest, using the magical elixir will show the chest instead.</p>
<p>The treasure chests can come in 3 varieties, and give increasing rewards.<br>There's also a chance that the pot really likes you and doesn't disappear after the first one, sticking around to guide you to a new chest.</p>

<h2>Battle content</h2>
<p>Besides killing overworld mobs, there's more fighting to be done in Occult Crescent.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight"><strong>⚠️ <span style="color: #f1c40f;">Warning</span></strong><br><br>Both FATEs and Critical Encounters are <strong>knowledge level agnostic</strong> and you will be able to participate at any point in time.<br><br>Do be careful tho, if you're venturing into higher level areas, mind your step between the roaming mobs as many of them will easily one shot you if you're moving carelessly.<br><br>Try to stick to going around them behind their backs by targeting them and looking at where their front arrow is pointed.</p>
<article>
<h3>FATEs</h3>
<p>FATEs spawn all around the map and can be challenged by any number of players up to the instance limit.<br>You may join at any point in the FATE to contribute.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Critical Encounters</h3>
<p>Critical Encounters also known as CEs are large-scale bosses.</p>
<p>Any number of players can participate in these up to the instance limit, however, these will be limited in access compared to FATEs.<br>While FATEs allow you to join at any point, CEs will only be available to the players that are within the <strong>CE combat area</strong> before the starting timer reaches 0 seconds.</p>
<p>After the timer is over, whoever is inside the area will be teleported into the combat arena and nobody else might join.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>The Forked Tower: Blood</h3>
<p>This is a high end level 100 raid that can only be accessed from within the Occult Crescent.</p>
<p>Personally, you need to be <strong>knowledge level 20</strong> and the instance scales from a minimum of 16 players up to the maximum of 48 players.</p>
<p>I will not go in depth on mechs, as the scope of this information page is not the raid, which would warrant a whole weyway page by itself.</p>
<h4>Accessing the tower</h4>
<p>To enter the tower, there's a set of requirements that must be met first.</p>
<ol>
<li>The zone weather needs to be <strong>Auroral Mirages</strong> which will last for around 5 minutes.</li>
<li>The zone itself must have <strong>at least</strong> 16 players with knowledge level 20 that have completed <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Past_and_Crescent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Past and Crescent</a></li>
<li>A minimum of 16 players need to use <strong>Sanguine Ciphers</strong> on the <strong>Cipher Reliquary</strong> at the centre of the map.</li>
<li>The node will activate and for a brief period of time it will teleport players inside, up to the 48 person limit.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Where do I get a Sanguine Cipher?</h4>
<p>You can purchase these from the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Expedition_Antiquarian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Expedition Antiquarian</strong></a> for <strong>600 Silver</strong> coins or <strong>960 Gold</strong> coins.</p>
<h4>I didn't go in, what happens to my ciphers?</h4>
<p>While you just need to be inside the teleport area to be randomly selected to go in, your chances will be much lower than the players that contribute Ciphers.</p>
<p>More than the required 16 initial ciphers can be contributed by others and players can contribute more than one cipher as well, this means that even if you use a cipher to go in, you might not get selected.<br>Basically, if there's less than the 48 player limit standing at the teleporter everyone will be selected, but if there are more than 48 players, the game will randomly select 48 players, with stacking increased chances for the ones that contributed more ciphers.</p>
<p>No worries tho, if you used your ciphers and did not get selected, they will be refunded back to you.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">✅ <span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Spawning chests!</strong></span><br><br>The way the spawns work are tied to activities being done inside your instance, so for every <strong>chain kill, CE</strong> or <strong>FATE</strong> completed, one chest will spawn for you, up to a maximum of 30 bronze and 4 silver at a time.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To start the quest chains for this set of relic weapons, there's some requirements that must be met beforehand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level needed to complete this chain is level 100 on a Disciple of War or Magic</li>
<li>Completion of the Main Scenario Quest <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Dawntrail_(Quest)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawntrail</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This relic is connected with a field operation, much like Eureka and Bozja relics before it.<br>As such, to start the relic quests you will need to start the quests to get access to the <a href="https://weyway.com/occult-crescent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occult crescent</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the information below will be subject to updates as we progress through the tiers of weapon.</p>
<p>For now, this information reflects what is currently out in <strong>7.25</strong> patch and will be continually updated as more parts release.</p>

<p>Lydirceil is on the hunt for a missing weaponsmith.</p>
<p class="align-right">- In-game description</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This relic starts by talking to <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Lydirceil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lydirceil</a> in the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Phantom_Village" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantom Village</a> (x:6.6 y:7.1).</p>
<p>After you're done finding our favourite drunk smith, you're on your way to the first steps.</p>
<p>Do you remember <strong>Atma</strong>?<br>Does it make you cry?<br>Well it's not atma this time, say hi to...</p>
<article id="demiatma">
<h4>Demiatma</h4>
<p>This first quest will have you collecting <strong>Demiatma</strong>.<br>As <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Gerolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerolt</a> put it...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a foul beastie in the throes o' death'll leave behind a crystallized chunk o' their life essence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These items are rare drops that can be obtained in two ways - either inside the <strong>Occult Crescent's South Horn</strong>, or through <strong>FATEs</strong> in other regions.</p>
<p>To complete the quest you will have to gather <strong>3 Demiatma</strong> from <strong>6 different types</strong>, for a total of <strong>18 drops.</strong><br>You will inevitably end up with more than the 3 required as you venture within the Occult Crescent but any extras you get as you grind, can be trashed at the end after you complete the quest.</p>
<p>While the devs might adjust this in the future; right now the drop rates for Demiatma are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical Encounters: <strong>20%</strong></li>
<li>FATEs (in Occult crescent &amp; outside): <strong>5%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Demiatma grind is a one-time step to enhance Gerolt's tools so do not despair;  grab any rum that Gerolt hasn't yet put his hands on and let's go!</p>
<h5>Within the Occult Crescent</h5>
<p>Complete <strong>FATE</strong><strong>s</strong> &amp; <strong>Critical Encounters</strong> with a gold rank within each of the marked zones, for a chance to receive the corresponding Demiatma.</p>

<p>Thankfully that's done!</p>
<p>Now you want relics right?.. Right?! </p>
<p>This quest is a repeatable one, you can do it as many times as you want for all the relics you need.</p>
<p>All you have to do is purchase 3 <strong><a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Arcanite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arcanite</a></strong> sold by <strong><a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ermina#vendor1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ermina</a></strong> (x:6.9 y:7.3) for <strong>500 Allagan Tomestones of Heliometry each.</strong></p>
<p>This will cost you <strong>1500</strong> tomes total, for each relic.</p>

<div class="el-p">

<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">Lastly, under <strong>Critical Missions</strong> you will find the crafts that can only be performed during <strong>Red Alert</strong> events.<br>It's recommended that you take part in these events and doing the crafts as many times as possible until the timer runs out as the rewards are significantly better than basic missions.</p>

<p dir="auto">I will do my best to provide below specific macros for every single mission I've completed just as a starting base.</p>

<h2>Lore</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A young researcher hailing from the Near East has come to Eorzea in search of aid. His field of study? Anima, an essence he considers to be a reflection of the soul. Through a chance encounter with the master craftsman Gerolt, he and the legendary blacksmith have joined forces to create a weapon the likes of which the realm has never seen.</p>
<p class="align-right">Patch 3.1 Official Site</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though it is only a matter of time before the anima fully develops, Ardashir believes he can hasten the process. To that end, he voyages to Idyllshire in search of an acquaintance, one Ulan. A fellow researcher and enthusiast of all creatures arcane, she has devoted her life to their study and methods by which they can be enhanced. Could her work be the key to unlocking the anima's potential?</p>
<p class="align-right">Patch 3.3 Official Site</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After many tests and trials, the anima would appear to be at the pinnacle of perfection. To that end, Ardashir is making preparations to return to the Near East that he might present his findings. Gerolt, on the other hand, believes there is yet work to be done. Could our resident drunkard and realm-renown blacksmith hold the key to the anima's advancement?</p>
<p class="align-right">Patch 3.4 Official Site</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As repair work on the Allagan droid progresses, it becomes clear that it won't be long until the anima weapon is fortified at last. Just what form will the anima take once all is said and done? Well, that's the million-gil question.</p>
<p class="align-right">Patch 3.5 Official Site</p>

<h2>Prerequesites</h2>
<p>As usual, there's a good website to help track where you stand on each of the steps of this relic grind: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ffxivrelictracker.com/" target="_blank">https://ffxivrelictracker.com/</a></p>
<ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li dir="auto" data-line="0">The level needed to complete this chain is <strong>level 60</strong>.</li>
<li dir="auto" data-line="1">Completion of the Main Scenario Quest <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Heavensward_(Quest)" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="Heavensward (Quest)" href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Heavensward_(Quest)" target="_blank">Heavensward</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">This relic will require a lot (like really a looot!) of <strong>Allagan Tomestone of Poetics</strong> as well as some <strong>Grand Company Seals</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="el-p">
<p dir="auto">It's also heavily recommended to have at least <strong>Second Lieutenant</strong> rank on your <strong>Grand Company</strong> of choice to purchase some of the materials required (they can be obtained in the marketboard as well!)</p>
<h2 class="el-h1">Initial Preparations</h2>
<p>While this relic has much less steps than the ARR one, the costs are condensed, as such, these quests will take well over <strong>8000 Allagan Tomestone of Poetics</strong> to complete, it's recommended that you avoid the 2000 cap on tomestones by spending on whatever materials you can buy along the way.</p>
<p class="el-p">The tables below will highlight some of the items that can be purchased and stocked up in preparation for the steps that will come.</p>
Some items will not be available to buy until you reach the step and unlock them.<br>Note that I might've missed something here, but this should at least give you a head start.</div>
<p class="msg msg--info">ℹ️ <span style="color: #3598db;"><strong>Info</strong></span><br><br>Some materials can be obtained via other means than what the tables specify, I've just organised them by tokens as that will cost less <strong>Gil </strong>in the long run.<br>If you want to see other options of obtaining each, click on the material names.</p>

<h2>Lore</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Eorzea has witnessed a resurgence of the old ways in recent days, as adventurers the realm over take up the ancient trades of warrior and dragoon, bard and black mage, and more. Now, it is the traditional weaponry of these old mantles that are sought, the means of their making long since lost to the ages. It would seem this longing for things past and old is not limited merely to the schools of war and magic. The reformation of Eorzea's Grand Companies was born of a longing in the hearts of the free peoples of Eorzea — a longing for the days of old and the peace they knew. It is a sentiment that has since spread to the realm's adventurers, guiding them toward the rediscovery of trades from a former age that had all but died out. Small wonder, then, that those who have mastered these ancient ways of battle and sorcery now seek the weapons of eld which will enable them to realize the truest expression of their newfound powers. Thus have adventurers begun their quest for the relics.</p>

<p>A good website that can help sorting through this unfathomable grind: <br><a class="external-link" href="https://ffxivrelictracker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> https://ffxivrelictracker.com/ </a></p>

<p class="align-left">In a seldom-traveled corner of the south sea isles lies Aloalo, an island filled with lush vegetation and teeming with vibrant wildlife. Yet the survival of this paradise hinges on a delicate natural balance which has only grown more precarious since the island's stewards departed a century ago. Answering the plea of a messenger most peculiar, you must join Matsya on a journey to restore order to Aloalo, and in the process uncover secrets long forgotten</p>
